## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stayvista.git
cd StayVista
```

### 1. API Service (`api/`)

```bash
cd api
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# set Mongo, JWT, Cloudinary credentials
npm run start
```

### 2. Guest App (`client/`)

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start            # launches on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Admin v2 Workspace (`admin_v2.0/`)

```bash
cd ../admin_v2.0
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev          # vite server on http://localhost:5173 (default)
```

### 4. (Optional) Legacy Admin v1 (`admin_v1.0/`)

```bash
cd ../admin_v1.0
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev          # CRA dev server on http://localhost:3001
```

> **Tip:** Run each module in its own terminal. All UIs target the API base URL defined in their respective `.env` files.

---

## üîê Environment Setup

- Copy `api/.env.example`, `client/.env.example`, `admin_v2.0/.env.example`, and `admin_v1.0/.env.example` before booting services.
- Required keys:
  - `MONGO`, `JWT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, `CLIENT_URL`, `ADMIN_URL` (`api/.env`).
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for `admin_v2.0/` (fallbacks to `/api`).
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL` for `client/` and `admin_v1.0/`.
- Recommended extras: enable Cloudinary credentials for media uploads and configure `NODE_ENV` for production logging control.

---

## üîç Module Deep Dive

- **Guest Web Application (`client/`)**
  - Immersive hero experiences, lifestyle-based property curation, property grids, editorial storytelling, and responsive design.
  - Booking flow integrates real-time availability, rate filters, and transaction history views.
  - Signup and onboarding tuned with consistent form placeholders and validation hints (`client/src/pages/register/Register.jsx`).
- **Admin Workspace v2 (`admin_v2.0/`)**
  - Protected routes via `AuthContext` (`admin_v2.0/src/App.jsx`).
  - Advanced stats: daily revenue, booking mix, transaction health, and 6-month revenue trends.
  - Data toolbelt with logs, bookings, transactions, hotels, rooms, and user management panels, plus deep single-resource editing experiences (`admin_v2.0/src/pages/single/Single.jsx`).
  - Consistent error extraction and login safeguards using `extractApiErrorMessage()` (`admin_v2.0/src/pages/login/Login.jsx`).
- **Admin Dashboard v1 (`admin_v1.0/`)**
  - Original Material UI + SASS dashboard; preserved for teams that still rely on legacy workflows.
- **API Service (`api/`)**
  - Route map: `/api/auth`, `/api/users`, `/api/hotels`, `/api/rooms`, `/api/upload`, `/api/bookings`, `/api/transactions`, `/api/analytics`.
  - `api/index.js` enforces environment validation, proxy trust, and centralized error handling.
  - Analytics controller computes aggregate metrics and same-day revenue lifts.

## üìö API Surface

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Hotels & Rooms**
  - CRUD endpoints with admin guardrails (`verifyAdmin`).
  - Media upload endpoints: `POST /api/upload/hotels` and `POST /api/upload/rooms`.
- **Bookings & Transactions**
  - `GET /api/bookings` with filter support, booking status transitions, and transaction audit trails.
  - `GET /api/transactions` with sorting, status normalization, and revenue aggregation.
- **Analytics**
  - `GET /api/analytics/summary` consolidates user, hotel, booking, transaction, and revenue streams.

> See `admin_v2.0/src/pages/transactions/Transactions.jsx` for the latest row normalization logic powering resilient dashboards.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability

- Stateless JWT authentication + signed cookies.
- Role-based guards for admin-only surfaces and critical mutations.
- Input validation, safe file handling, and defensive error responses.
- CORS configuration tuned per client/admin domain via `CLIENT_URL` and `ADMIN_URL` env keys.
- Graceful MongoDB connection handling with disconnect resilience.

> Authentication flows leverage trimmed and sanitized identifiers, ensuring safe login experiences across email, phone, and username inputs (`admin_v2.0/src/pages/login/Login.jsx`).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Toolkit

- Code-splitting and lazy routing for guest & admin apps.
- Cloudinary transformations for responsive image delivery.
- Indexed MongoDB collections with aggregation pipelines for analytics.
- Vite-driven HMR (admin v2) and minimal bundles for runtime efficiency.

> Transaction grids debounce re-rendering through memoized column definitions and height virtualization, keeping KPI tables fluid under load (`admin_v2.0/src/pages/transactions/Transactions.jsx`).

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Experience Toolkit

- **Linting & Formatting**
  - Admin workspace: `npm run lint` (ESLint flat config in `admin_v2.0/eslint.config.js`).
  - Auto-fix: `npm run lint -- --fix` for rapid hygiene passes.
  - Prettier formatting aligned across modules; configure editors to respect `.editorconfig`.
- **Testing & Validation**
  - Targeted integration via Postman collections (`api/collections/`) or Thunder Client.
  - Manual smoke tests: login, invite user, create hotel, create room, capture transaction.
- **Debugging helpers**
  - `extractApiErrorMessage()` centralizes API error parsing (`admin_v2.0/src/utils/error.js`).
  - Session messaging utilities (`admin_v2.0/src/utils/session.js`) preserve toasts across redirects.
- **Recommended VS Code Extensions**
  - ESLint, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, GitLens, Thunder Client, and REST Client for API exploration.
- **Scripts Recap**
  - `npm run dev` ‚Üí Vite dev server with fast HMR.
  - `npm run build` ‚Üí Production bundle, outputs to `dist/`.
  - `npm run preview` ‚Üí Local preview of production build.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Playbook

- **API (`api/`)**
  - Target Node 18+ environment (Render, Railway, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
  - Configure environment variables: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLIENT_URL`, `ADMIN_URL`, `CLOUDINARY_*` keys.
  - Enable automated backups for MongoDB Atlas; leverage Vercel/Netlify edge for web caching.
- **Admin v2 (`admin_v2.0/`)**
  - Build with `npm run build`; deploy `dist/` to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
  - Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the API origin. Use environment-specific values for staging/production.
  - Consider password-protecting staging environments via edge middleware.
- **Client (`client/`)**
  - CRA-style build (`npm run build`) deployable to Netlify, Vercel, or static S3 hosting.
  - Ensure `REACT_APP_API_URL` aligns with API base and includes HTTPS.
- **Legacy Admin (`admin_v1.0/`)**
  - Optional deployment for teams needing the historical experience; treat as maintenance mode.
- **Observability**
  - Recommend integrating Logtail/DataDog for API logs, Vercel Analytics for frontend, and MongoDB Atlas metrics.
  - Configure uptime checks for `/api/health` and `/api/analytics/summary` endpoints.
