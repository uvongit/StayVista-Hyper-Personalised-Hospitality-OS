## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stayvista.git
cd StayVista
```

### 1. API Service (`api/`)

```bash
cd api
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# set Mongo, JWT, Cloudinary credentials
npm run start
```

### 2. Guest App (`client/`)

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start            # launches on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Admin v2 Workspace (`admin_v2.0/`)

```bash
cd ../admin_v2.0
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev          # vite server on http://localhost:5173 (default)
```

### 4. (Optional) Legacy Admin v1 (`admin_v1.0/`)

```bash
cd ../admin_v1.0
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev          # CRA dev server on http://localhost:3001
```

> **Tip:** Run each module in its own terminal. All UIs target the API base URL defined in their respective `.env` files.

## üîê Environment Setup

- Copy `api/.env.example`, `client/.env.example`, `admin_v2.0/.env.example`, and `admin_v1.0/.env.example` before booting services.
- Required keys:
  - `MONGO`, `JWT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, `CLIENT_URL`, `ADMIN_URL` (`api/.env`).
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for `admin_v2.0/` (fallbacks to `/api`).
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL` for `client/` and `admin_v1.0/`.
- Recommended extras: enable Cloudinary credentials for media uploads and configure `NODE_ENV` for production logging control.

---

## üîç Module Deep Dive

- **Guest Web Application (`client/`)**
  - Immersive hero experiences, lifestyle-based property curation, property grids, editorial storytelling, and responsive design.
  - Booking flow integrates real-time availability, rate filters, and transaction history views.
- **Admin Workspace v2 (`admin_v2.0/`)**
  - Protected routes via `AuthContext` (`admin_v2.0/src/App.jsx`).
  - Advanced stats: daily revenue, booking mix, transaction health, and 6-month revenue trends.
  - Data toolbelt with logs, bookings, transactions, hotels, rooms, and user management panels.
- **Admin Dashboard v1 (`admin_v1.0/`)**
  - Original Material UI + SASS dashboard; preserved for teams that still rely on legacy workflows.
- **API Service (`api/`)**
  - Route map: `/api/auth`, `/api/users`, `/api/hotels`, `/api/rooms`, `/api/upload`, `/api/bookings`, `/api/transactions`, `/api/analytics`.
  - `api/index.js` enforces environment validation, proxy trust, and centralized error handling.
  - Analytics controller computes aggregate metrics and same-day revenue lifts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Toolkit

- Code-splitting and lazy routing for guest & admin apps.
- Cloudinary transformations for responsive image delivery.
